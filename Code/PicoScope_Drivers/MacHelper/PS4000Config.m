%% PS4000Config Configure path information
% Configures paths according to platforms and loads information from
% prototype files for PicoScope 4000 Series Oscilloscopes. The folder 
% that this file is located in must be added to the MATLAB path.
%
% Platform Specific Information:-
%
% Microsoft Windows: Download the Software Development Kit installer from
% the <a href="matlab: web('https://www.picotech.com/downloads#t3')">Pico Technology Download software and manuals for oscilloscopes and data loggers</a> page.
% 
% Linux: Follow the instructions to install the libps4000 and libpswrappers
% packages from the <a href="matlab:
% web('https://www.picotech.com/downloads/linux')">Pico Technology Linux Software & Drivers for Oscilloscopes and Data Loggers</a> page.
%
% Apple Mac OS X: Follow the instructions to install the PicoScope 6
% application from the <a href="matlab: web('https://www.picotech.com/downloads#t3')">Pico Technology Download software and manuals for oscilloscopes and data loggers</a> page.
% Optionally, create a 'maci64' folder in the same directory as this file
% and copy the libps4000.dylib, libps4000Wrap.dylib and libpicoipp.dylib files
% into it. Contact our Technical Support team via the <a href="matlab: web('https://www.picotech.com/tech-support/')">Technical Enquiries form</a> for further assistance.

% Run this script in the MATLAB environment prior to connecting to the 
% device.
