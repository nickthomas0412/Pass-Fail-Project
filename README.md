## Final Year Project - Pass/fail testing of additive manufacturing structures using machine learning algorithms

Aim: Develop a quick, reliable vibration testing method with machine learning algorithms to discern an undamaged additively manufactured turbine blade from a damaged one.

This repository contains all of the CAD and MATLAB files used in the project.

To use the MATLAB application, clone or download this repository and open it as the root folder in MATLAB
