## Final Year Project - Pass/fail testing of additive manufacturing structures using machine learning algorithms

Aim: Develop a quick, reliable vibration testing method with machine learning algorithms to discern an undamaged additively manufactured turbine blade from a damaged one.

This repository contains the redacted Final Report and this README file. The source files of the Code and CAD are kept in a private repository. 

To gain access to the private repository please contact [me](mailto:nickthomas0412@gmail.com). If this is for the University of Bath, then please show this to your supervisor and get them to contact me.
